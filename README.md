<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹  I'm Joakim!</h1>
<h3 align="center">A full stack developer living in Oslo, Norway</h3>
<p align="center">Currently working as a consultant at </SALT> School of Applied Technology! After working in E-commerce for two years, I decided to switch careers and become a professional web developer. I enjoy building apps & products, and learning new technologies along the way. Working mostly with React/Express/Node/MongoDB, as well as Jest/Mocha for TDD.</p>

<h3> Work-in-progress: </h3>
<ul>
<li> <h4> <a href="https://github.com/hagenek/polka">Polka Meet app</a> </h4> Together with my mob we created an app aimed at improving social life during pandemics for people with disabilities. Deployed <a href="https://polkat.herokuapp.com/">here</a> with Heroku.   
  
  Frontend - React, Axios, Socket.io
  
  Backend - NodeJS, ExpressJS, JWT authentication, Socket.io, MongoDB + Mongoose
</li>

<li> <h4> <a href="https://github.com/Joakim-Andersson/Seasonal-produce">Recipe site with Seasonal Produce</a> </h4> 
Single-page application that shows which produce that's in season for your area, and fetches relevant recipes using these ingredients. A one day hackathon project which I intend to develop further.
  
  Frontend - React
 
 Backend - NodeJS, ExpressJS, RESTful API
